# Background
Data is more powerful when we share it with others! I created a dashboard using visualizations created from a previous assignment. In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations, There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all the plots, and another page where you can view the data used to build them.
